## Object Oriented Programming
### Encapsulation*
<ol>
    <li> Combining/Wrapping of data and methods. Data is available to methods of class for modification. </li>
    <li> ** private ** keyword is used for data hiding. These variables cannot be modified from other classes. **setter** and **getter** public methods do the job of modification and read. </li>
    <li> Principle benefit of Encapsulation is control over data is high. Implementation details are invisible/hidden to user.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> private : Higher Restriction. </li>
            <li> public : Lowest Restriction of Access</li>
            <li> protected : More restricted than **public** and less restricted than **private**</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

### Polymorphism*
<ul>
    <li>Polymorphism is a class relational concept where multiple subclasses exist for a super class and each subclass has it's own implementation of inherited methods. Existing of different forms for a given method is polymorphism.</li>
</ul>

### Overloading & Overriding
** Overloading : ** It's programming language feature where a method's parameters or return type or both are changed to requirement. This way method can support different types of inputs. Arguments of method should change in terms of type in overloading. It's called compile time polymorphism.
> <br/>
** Overriding : ** It's a high level languages feature where one can change the logic of super class method according necessity of subclass with the choice to change method access level, arguments, return type. It's called run time polymorphism.

### Inheritance*
<ul>
<li>Inheritance Java Syntax Keywords : extends</li>
<li> Inheritance is process of one class inherting non private variables and methods of another class. Inheriting class is subclass and inherited class is super class. </li>
<li> Constructors are not inherited to sub class since they are non member methods. It is propery of Inheritance that constructor of super class is called during initialisation of sub class.</li>
</ul>
